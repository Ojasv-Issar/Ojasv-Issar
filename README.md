## 👋 Who I Am

I’m Ojasv, a **Master of Data Science student at UBC** with a Computer Science + Data Science background.  
I like problems where **data is chaotic, constraints are real, and the outcome is measurable**.

I bounce between:

- Building **ML & GenAI systems** end-to-end (from scraping and ETL to deployment).  
- Doing **climate and urban analytics** that say something real about the world.  
- Designing **clean, explainable artifacts** – dashboards, visualizations, and writeups people actually read.

If it mixes **systems thinking, impact, and good design**, I’m interested.

---

## 🎯 What I’m Currently Doing

- 📚 Sharpening **ML & statistical modeling** at scale.  
- ☁️ Building **cloud-native ML pipelines** and learning the unglamorous parts: logging, monitoring, failures.  
- 🌍 Working on **climate, urban, and social-data projects** that go beyond toy datasets.  
- 💡 Exploring **LLMs, RAG, and evaluation** for real use cases, not just demos.

## 🧰 Tech I Actually Use

I’m comfortable going from **data collection → feature engineering → modeling → visualization → deployment**.  
Tools are negotiable; **clarity and repeatability** are not.

## 🚀 Projects That Represent Me

### 🌡 Climate Change Forecasting

> Forecasting global temperature trends instead of just plotting historical lines.

- Modeled **long-term land temperature** using classic and modern time-series approaches.  
- Focused on **reproducibility**: clean notebooks, versioned data, and transparent assumptions.  
- Used forecasts to discuss **warming scenarios** rather than just model metrics.

**Stack:** Python · Pandas · scikit-learn · Jupyter  

🔗 [Repo](https://github.com/Ojasv-Issar/Climate-Change-Forecasting)

### 📊 Netflix Analytics Dashboard

> Turning “I feel like Netflix is…” into actual numbers.

- Analyzed **8,000+ titles** to surface patterns in genres, countries, and release timelines.  
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for drilling into content by segment.  
- Framed **business-style questions** (content gaps, regional focus) instead of just descriptive stats.

**Stack:** Power BI · Data Modeling  

🔗 [Repo](https://github.com/Ojasv-Issar/Netflix-Analytics-Dashboard-)

### 🏙 NYC Airbnb Analysis

> How did post-pandemic pricing really shift across New York’s boroughs?

- Performed **EDA on 100k+ listings** to uncover demand, pricing, and neighborhood patterns.  
- Combined **spatial and pricing analysis** to show where recovery accelerated or lagged.  
- Focused on **visual-first storytelling** to keep insights non-specialist-friendly.

**Stack:** Python · Pandas · Matplotlib  

🔗 [Repo](https://github.com/Ojasv-Issar/New-York-AIRBNB-Analysis)

### ☁️ UBC Reddit Reporter (Contributor)

> A serverless pipeline that keeps UBC’s Reddit pulse in one place.

- Helped build a **Lambda + Bedrock** workflow that ingests, categorizes, and summarizes posts.  
- Treated Reddit as a **noisy signal** for student sentiment and surfaced it as structured summaries.  
- Focused on **reliability, automation, and readable outputs**, not just model cleverness.

**Stack:** AWS SAM · AWS Lambda · Bedrock · Python · NLP
